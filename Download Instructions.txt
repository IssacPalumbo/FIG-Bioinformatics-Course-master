1. Go to the git repository "https://github.com/vparrello/FIG-Bioinformatics-Course/tree/master" and look for the green "<> Code" button. It can be found on the righthand side of the page between the "Add File" button and the "About" section.

2. Once you click on the button, you will find a "Download zip" button that contains all the files in the repository. Click on "Download Zip" to download the repository.

3. Find the file in your downloads folder and upzip it into a Project folder. It will create a folder in that space called "FIG-Bioinformatics-Course-master". Take note of where this folder is as you will need to navigate there in vscode.

4. If you have already downloaded VSCode, then skip to step 11. Otherwise, download vscode from "https://code.visualstudio.com/download" according to your operating system.

5. Find the file you just downloaded in your downloads folder and execute the file to start the installation.

6. Follow the instructions for the installation wizard until it goes to finish. All the default values used are acceptable for our purposes. If it does not automatically start VSCode when it finishes, search for it in your programs and apps to launch it.

7. When vscode launches, find "File" in the far left hand corner of the application. I'm talking all the way in that corner. Right next to the logo in windows or "Code" on Mac machines.

8. Choose Open Folder. Then find the "FIG-Bioinformatics-Course-master" folder you just put onto your computer and select it. This is the file from Step 3. It will prompt you to ask if you trust the authors. I would reccommend yes because I trust myself but that's up to you.

9. Happy Dance! You are done with your setup! Now go to your first exercise under 1 - Representative Genomes to get started.
